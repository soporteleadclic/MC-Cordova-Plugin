### Version 6.0.0

In this release we have greatly simplified the Cordova plugin for our MobilePush SDK.  For greatest success, if you are upgrading from a prior release, we suggest following the integration instructions as if this were a new plugin.

All functionality of this plugin remains the same as the preceding versions.

* The plugin version number will now match with the `major`.`minor` version of the SDK release.
* The plugin is now published to npm for easier installation
* The Javascript API has been updated to allow for optional parameters where applicable.  Refer to the [API Reference](README.md#reference) for more details.
* Moved SDK configuration values from command line arguments passed in while installing the SDK into the `config.xml` file.
